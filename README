How to use:

You will need to have GAP installed with the Semigroups, Images and Ferret packages:

  GAP       : https://github.com/gap-system/gap

  Semigroups: https://github.com/gap-packages/Semigroups
  Images    : https://github.com/gap-packages/images
  Ferret    : https://github.com/gap-packages/ferret

The functions AllZeroSimpleSemigroups, AllSimpleSemigroups,
IteratorOfZeroSimpleSemigroups and IteratorOfSimpleSemigroups can be used with
either two arguments (order, anti_iso) or four (nr_rows, nr_cols, G, anti-iso).
These functions list the RZMS / RMS with these parameters up to isomorphism or
anti-isomorphism.

order (integer) - order of semigroup
anti_iso (boolean) - enumerate up to anti-isomorphism?
nr_rows, nr_cols (integer) - how many rows / columns of the matrix defining the
                             RZMS / RMS
G - the group over which the RZMS / RMS is defined

The functions NrZeroSimpleSemigroups and NrSimpleSemigroups can be called with
one argument which is either (order) or (list) where list is a list of length 3
[nr_rows, nr_cols, G]. These functions count how many (0-)simple semigroups
there are with these parameters up to isomorphism.
