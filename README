How to use:

Extract the shapes files:

  tar -xvzf shapes.tar.gz 

Edit line 197 of the file EnumRZMSShapes.g:

  prefix := "/Users/crussell/Desktop/shapes/shapes-";

so that it points to the directory of the shapes folder which is part of this
pacakge. E.g.

  prefix := "/path/to/shapes/folder/shape/shapes-";

Then open GAP and use the Read method to Read the files EnumRZMSShapes.g
followed by EnumRZMS.g.

The function RZMSMain(k, [G, m, n, anti]) can be used with up to 5 arguments to
enumerate the 0-simple RZMS of order k. The optional arguments can be either 0 or

G - a group which the RZMS must be over
m - the number of rows which the matrix of the RZMS should have
n - the number of columns which the matrix of the RZMS should have
anti (default = true) - true indicates that RZMS should be enmumerated up to
anti-isomorphism. False indicates they should be enumerated up to isomorphism.

setting any of these to 0 or ommitting them implies that you don't want to
filtered the RZMS of order k by that parameter. If specifying m then you must
specify G (possibly as 0). If specifying n you must specify G and m. If
specifying anti you must specify all arguments.
